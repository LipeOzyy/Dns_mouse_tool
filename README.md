# Dns_mouse_tool

DNS_Mouse is a simple yet efficient Python tool designed to perform subdirectory scanning on web servers. It automates the discovery of publicly accessible directories on a website or server, similar to how Gobuster works. The tool can be useful for penetration testing and security audits, helping to identify sensitive and vulnerable areas of a server.
